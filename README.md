# ==Flight Ticket Prediction Machine Learning Project==
Welcome to the Flight Ticket Prediction Machine Learning Project! This project utilizes the Random Forest Regressor model to predict flight ticket prices with a targeted accuracy of 98%. MongoDB is used as the database for the data source, and Docker is employed for container creation. The application is deployed on Google Cloud Run platform. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project successfully.

## Project Structure
### data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
### notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
### src: Source code files for the machine learning model.
### requirements.txt: Dependencies required for running the project.
### Dockerfile: Configuration file for building the Docker container.
